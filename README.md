# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

well first i opened my terminal, went into my week 2 file and cloned this directory into it, from there I added more gems and finished up by opening vs code now im here.I don't know if i would call it a process but i had a order that i followed.

2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
The hardest part of it is finding the small details that went wrong like a misspeling because they are easily looked over.
3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?in I don't think it made anything easier persay but it made it way quicker to get through everything and saved a lot of headache.
